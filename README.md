#Upgrad Speed Increaser
This is a very basic chrome extension to help speed up the video.

How it helps?
- Basically if you see a video at 2x speed then you are gaining the same information in a small time. though initially it can be challenging to grasp so it is recommended to increase the speed according to your own pace.
- Sometimes when you are revising certain points gets boring though they provide a lot of value. watching at increased speed here will again save time.
